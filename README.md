canvas_tetris
=============

A clone of Gameboy Tetris using HTML5 canvas written in javascript.

This is a simple project I made some time ago to try and figure out the algorithms behind Tetris.
For fun, I thought it would also be nice to make it look exactly like the original Gameboy version
of the game, so I ripped graphics from screenshots I found on the internet and grabbed as many
sound effects as I could find from videos.

It seems to work! Space to start the game, the arrow keys move the Tetrimonos.
